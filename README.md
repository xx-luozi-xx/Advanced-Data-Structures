# Advanced-Data-Structures
&emsp;&emsp;Here are some C++ Templates using advanced data structures. These codes have been tested with some simple examples, but they may also contain potential bugs. If you run the code and find any bugs, please contact me first :) .

&emsp;&emsp;There are some other advanced data structures that are application-specific, such as segment trees. You can find them in my [algorithm question warehouse](https://github.com/xx-luozi-xx/algorithm-question-warehouse).

&emsp;&emsp;For more general templates, see [here](https://github.com/xx-luozi-xx/LZ_STL).
